# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Print Geometry
Build the Docker-hosted React/Vite/shadcn/Tailwind web app skeleton, define the outdoor field-guide visual system, accept bounding boxes, create page grid, generate overview and detail pages, and validate Letter-size PDF output from the preferred client-side React PDF path.

## Phase 2: Map Sources
Add OSM-derived vectors, USGS public-domain layers, Natural Earth overview data, and source-specific attribution.

## Phase 3: Routes and Landmarks
Import or calculate routes, simplify polylines, find nearby landmarks, and render callouts without label collisions.

## Phase 4: Offline Regions
Add provider-permitted PMTiles or MBTiles downloads for selected regions, cache invalidation, and disk-size estimates.

## Phase 5: Education Layer
Add compass lessons, map-scale exercises, landmark challenges, and printable navigator worksheets.

## Phase 6: Product Polish
Add templates, branding, preview editing, print calibration, shareable saved projects, and then evaluate Tauri packaging for offline/app-store distribution.

## Phase 7: Mobile Atlas
After the printing version is excellent, explore an Android app that reuses the generated atlas model. Prioritize an atlas-page interface that mimics the rendered PDFs, then add a conventional mobile map mode with current location, route context, and page-grid overlay.
